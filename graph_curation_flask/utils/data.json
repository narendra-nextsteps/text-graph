Its one end, which points towards north, is\ncalled a north pole, and the other end, which points towards south, is called a\nsouth pole.\nA magnetic field exists in the region surrounding a magnet, in which the force of\nthe magnet can be detected.\nField lines are used to represent a magnetic field. A field line is the path along\nwhich a hypothetical free north pole would tend to move. The direction of the\nmagnetic field at a point is given by the direction that a north pole placed at that\npoint would take. Field lines are shown closer together where the magnetic field is\ngreater.\nA metallic wire carrying an electric current has associated with it a magnetic field.\nThe field lines about the wire consist of a series of concentric circles whose direction\nis given by the right-hand rule.\nThe pattern of the magnetic field around a conductor due to an electric current\nflowing through it depends on the shape of the conductor. The magnetic field of a\nsolenoid carrying a current is similar to that of a bar magnet.\nAn electromagnet consists of a core of soft iron wrapped around with a coil of\ninsulated copper wire.\nA current-carrying conductor when placed in a magnetic field experiences a force.\nIf the direction of the field and that of the current are mutually perpendicular to\neach other, then the force acting on the conductor will be perpendicular to both\nand will be given by Fleming’s left-hand rule. This is the basis of an electric motor.\nAn electric motor is a device that converts electric energy into mechanical energy.\nThe phenomenon of electromagnetic induction is the production of induced current\nin a coil placed in a region where the magnetic field changes with time. The magnetic\nfield may change due to a relative motion between the coil and a magnet placed\nnear to the coil. If the coil is placed near to a current-carrying conductor, the\nmagnetic field may change either due to a change in the current through the\nconductor or due to the relative motion between the coil and conductor. The\ndirection of the induced current is given by the Fleming’s right-hand rule.\nA generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. It works on the basis\nof electromagnetic induction.\nIn our houses we receive AC electric power of 220 V with a frequency of 50 Hz. One\nof the wires in this supply is with red insulation, called live wire. The other one is of\nblack insulation, which is a neutral wire. The potential difference between the two\nis 220 V. The third is the earth wire that has green insulation and this is connected\nto a metallic body deep inside earth. It is used as a safety measure to ensure that\nany leakage of current to a metallic body does not give any severe shock to a user.\nFuse is the most important safety device, used for protecting the circuits due to\nshort-circuiting or overloading of the circuits.",

      "raw_text": "We have so far observed the pattern of the magnetic field lines\nproduced around a current-carrying straight wire. Suppose\nthis straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and a\ncurrent is passed through it. How would the magnetic field\nlines look like? We know that the magnetic field produced\nby a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the\ndistance from it. Similarly at every point of a current-carrying\ncircular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic\nfield around it would become larger and larger as we move\naway from the wire (Fig. 13.8). By the time we reach at the\ncentre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would\nappear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying\ncurrent would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as\nstraight lines at the center of the loop. By applying the right\nhand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire\ncontributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction\nwithin the loop.",

      "raw_text": "Current in the coil ABCD enters from the\nsource battery through conducting brush\nX and flows back to the battery through\nbrush Y. Notice that the current in arm AB\nof the coil flows from A to B. In arm CD it\nflows from C to D, that is, opposite to the\ndirection of current through arm AB. On\napplying Fleming’s left hand rule for the\ndirection of force on a current-carrying\nconductor in a magnetic field (see Fig. 13.13). We find that the force\nacting on arm AB pushes it downwards while the force acting on arm\nCD pushes it upwards. Thus the coil and the axle O, mounted free to\nturn about an axis, rotate anti-clockwise. At half rotation, Q makes\ncontact with the brush X and P with brush Y. Therefore the current in\nthe coil gets reversed and flows along the path DCBA. A device that\nreverses the direction of flow of current through a circuit is called a\ncommutator. In electric motors, the split ring acts as a commutator. The\nreversal of current also reverses the direction of force acting on the two\narms AB and CD. Thus the arm AB of the coil that was earlier pushed\ndown is now pushed up and the arm CD previously pushed up is now\npushed down. Therefore the coil and the axle rotate half a turn more in\nthe same direction. The reversing of the current is repeated at each half\nrotation, giving rise to a continuous rotation of the coil and to the axle.",

      "raw_text": "From these observations, we conclude that a potential difference is\ninduced in the coil-2 whenever the electric current through the coil–1\nis changing (starting or stopping). Coil-1 is called the primary coil and\ncoil-2 is called the secondary coil. As the current in the first coil changes,\nthe magnetic field associated with it also changes. Thus the magnetic\nfield lines around the secondary coil also change. Hence the change in\nmagnetic field lines associated with the secondary coil is the cause of\ninduced electric current in it. This process, by which a changing\nmagnetic field in a conductor induces a current in another conductor,\nis called electromagnetic induction. In practice we can induce current\nin a coil either by moving it in a magnetic field or by changing the\nmagnetic field around it. It is convenient in most situations to move\nthe coil in a magnetic field.",

A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the\nappliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur\nwhen the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This\noccurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the\nappliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly\nincreases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse\nprevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage\nby stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating\nthat takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit.\nOverloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply\nvoltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many\nappliances to a single socket.",
